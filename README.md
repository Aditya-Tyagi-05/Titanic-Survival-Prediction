# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Description
This project focuses on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers based on various features using a logistic regression model. The Jupyter Notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to provide accurate survival predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Logistic regression model for survival prediction
- Model performance evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
